## Paint-With-Opencv [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)
This code helps you to draw basic geometrical shapes using Opencv

### Code Requirements
The example code is in Python([version 3.0](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) or higher will work).
You need to install opencv library


### Description

To be able to paint with opencv, I have integrated drawing tools, mouse motion and color palette in one. This project is just a part of large Geometric Object Recognition project that will recognize the objects drawn using basic shapes like circle, rectangle etc. Unlike the conventional method, this is the novelty which reduces the dependency on different modules.  

Shapes that can be drawn are **Circle**, **Rectangle**, **Line** using some different keyboard letter taps like `c`, `r` and `l` for the former respectively.


### Guide

*Paint with opencv by simply running the program.
*Use `l`, `r`, `c` and `e` to toggle between different options.
*I have included the **Eraser** in case you might need it!

### Execution
To run the code, open the terminal and type `python Draw.py`

```
python Draw.py
```
